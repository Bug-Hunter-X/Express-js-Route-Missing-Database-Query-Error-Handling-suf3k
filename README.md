# Express.js Route Missing Database Query Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js routes: neglecting to handle errors that might occur during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches a user by ID but lacks proper error handling for database query failures.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug

The original code fetches a user from a database. If the user is not found, a 404 error is returned. However, if the database query itself fails (e.g., due to a connection issue or invalid query), the route doesn't handle this, leading to an unhandled exception and potential application crash. 

## Solution

The solution adds a `try...catch` block to wrap the database query.  This allows the route to gracefully handle potential errors, returning an appropriate error response to the client instead of crashing.
